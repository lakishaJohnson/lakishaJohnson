Learning to learn to code is not an easy task. But I am so proud of myself for the progress I've made so far. I know I have a long way to go but if I continue to "fail forward" and "own my pursuit", I'm confident in my ability to become an awesome Software Engineer.

This is my all-time favorite code, because I found it on Stack Overflow.  

```
const underscore_word = new Array(word.length).fill("_");
```
