That's my name right up there but I like to be called "Kisha" or "Kisha J."... sounds hot.
Learning to learn to code is not an easy task. But I am so proud of myself for the progress I've made so far. I know I have a long way to go but if I continue to "fail forward" and "own my pursuit", I'm confident in my ability to become an awesome Software Engineer.
